  <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Don Hughes 
    a musician whose songwriting abilities can best be described as &#8216;hooky.&#8217; 
    A gifted country singer and songwriter, Hughes&#8217; love of making music 
    and telling stories comes across in his latest CD That&#8217;s How Far Love 
    Goes. It is the second release through Hughes&#8217; Smart Guy Music label 
    and the second consecutive CD produced by Marty Rifkin (Bruce Springsteen, 
    Dwight Yoakum.) It features ten original songs by Don Hughes including the 
    singles &#8220;That&#8217;s How Far Love Goes,&#8221; which spent eighteen 
    weeks on European radio charts and &#8220;Illusions of Love,&#8221; which 
    reached #1 on the UK radio charts in March 2005.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hughes 
    grew up in Anderson, a small country town in Northern California and, like 
    most kids, he enjoyed listening to rock n&#8217; roll. It was the Beatles 
    who inspired him to play guitar. He began guitar lessons at the age of eight 
    and went on to study music at Mt. Hood College in Oregon where he majored 
    in theory and composition. He continued to study music and began vocal training 
    and it wasn&#8217;t long before he was writing his own songs. In fact it&#8217;s 
    the crafting of songs that he says he enjoys most -- creating a great story, 
    adding a melody, and finding an infectious hook. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Don Hughes&#8217; 
    talents go beyond music. After college he moved to Los Angeles to pursue music. 
    However an agent encouraged him to study acting, and he was soon at work on 
    commercials and modeling. He continued writing and performing rock n&#8217; 
    roll, jazz, R&amp;B, and pop music while acting. Commercials led to Soap Operas 
    and ultimately leading roles in feature films. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hughes&#8217; 
    was spending as much time as possible writing music. Having been a student 
    of all music and a lover of the &#8216;story&#8217;, it took a good friend 
    to point out that he had written a country song and that it was the best he&#8217;d 
    ever written. He was country and he was hooked. From that point Hughes has 
    devoted all his time to the genre that he feels is a &#8216;natural fit&#8217; 
    and has established an extensive catalog. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hughes 
    met producer Marty Rifkin through a mutual friend who believed Rifkin would 
    want to work with Hughes. The two immediately connected and since have collaborated 
    on two CDs. In fact, Rifkin appears on all recordings with Hughes. Rifkin 
    has praised Hughes&#8217; songwriting as &#8216;full of hope and never bitter.&#8221; 
    </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Don Hughes 
    currently lives in Redondo Beach, California and is already at work on a third 
    CD, which he plans to record in early 2006. Hughes will release several more 
    singles from That&#8217;s How Far Love Goes and is preparing to support the 
    CD with an upcoming tour. His long-term touring goals include Europe, where 
    he finds himself in high demand. He is in the process of assembling top-notch 
    musicians and expects to be out on the road by fall. One other dream Don Hughes 
    would like to see come true is his foundation for children</font>.</p>
